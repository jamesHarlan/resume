Hello!\\

I am very interesting in your configuration administrator role at Oracle!

I am currently fluent in JavaScript and pick up new tech quickly.  I am interested how Oracle uses automated systems to analyze complex business problems.  My coding, unit testing, and troubleshooting experience are all highly relevant to the job listing and I feel I have the skills to become a strong member of your team.

I am eager to work with the best and brightest using the best technology to solve challenging problems!
\\
\closing{Regards,}
